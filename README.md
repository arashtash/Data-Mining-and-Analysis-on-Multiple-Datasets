# DataMiningAssignments
This Repository includes 3 assignments that I have done for my Data Mining and Warehousing course at Dalhousie University

Assignments details are available on the Jupyter notebooks.

Part 1: Data Preprocessing and Warehousing

Focused on constructing and using a data warehouse with healthcare data.
Performed data loading and cleaning on publicly available COVID-19 data for Nova Scotia (2014-2017).
Applied techniques to handle complex data, ensuring its readiness for analysis and decision-making.
Created plots using matplotlib.
Libraries used: NumPy, Pandas, MatplotLib, Seaborn, SciPy, Scikit-learn

Part 2: OLAP and Discretization

Explored data cube and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) concepts.
Applied discretization methods to data on anti-democratic political movements and conflicts in Brazil.
Conducted BUC computation to efficiently aggregate and summarize the multidimensional data for analysis.
Libraries used: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, MatplotLib

Part 3: Clustering and Classification

Implemented and compared k-means clustering algorithms on two datasets: GiveMeSomeCredit and the Iris flower dataset.
Utilized scikit-learn for machine learning tasks, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and simple neural networks.
Applied classification techniques to predict outcomes based on observed features, helping decision-making processes.
Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
